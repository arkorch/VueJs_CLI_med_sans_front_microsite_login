          <h4>Over-medication</h4>
          <p>
            Superbugs are increasingly appearing in food-MRSA in pork, resistant salmonella in
            turkey-and have caused widespread outbreaks of food poisoning in the U.S. Because meat
            and poultry producers are not required to report how they use the drugs-which ones, how
            much, what animals-documenting a clear connection between.
          </p>

          <h4>Anti-Biotics in Food</h4>
          <p>
            More antibiotics go into the food we eat than we take ourselves. About 80 percent of all
            antibiotics sold in the United States are used on farm animals. Most animals are dosed
            regularly-sometimes even daily-with antibiotic-laced food and water in a practice known
            as subtherapeutic administration.

            Nevertheless, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other government
            agencies have testified before Congress that there is a definitive link between the two.
            This position is supported by the American Medical Association, the American Academy of
            Pediatrics, the World Health Organization and other leading public health and medical
            groups.
